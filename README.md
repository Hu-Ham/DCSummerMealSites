# DCSummerMealSites

This is an accessible map of DC containing the locations listed in their Summer Meals program for kids 18 and younger.
This file should be used in some sort of XAMP or lamp stack. I used XAMPP control panel (If thats the way you wanna go then throw this in htdocs and upload the dataset here https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::summer-meals-sites/about to phpMyAdmin)
